# SmartResolution

Viewing this on GitHub? [Go to http://smartresolution.org instead](http://smartresolution.org). The links below will work properly there.

SmartResolution is an open-source Online Dispute Resolution platform, currently under construction as a dissertation by [Chris Ashton](http://ashton.codes) who is a final year Software Engineering student at Aberystwyth University. [Read more about the dissertation here](/about).

The aim is for the ODR platform to be:

* Free and open source software (FOSS), meaning anyone can install the software for any purpose.
* Fully extensible, meaning developers can write modules that can be plugged into any installation of SmartResolution.
* Enterprise level, backed up by integration and unit tests, continuous integration, CodeClimate and other tools.
