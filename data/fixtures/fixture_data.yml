    summary_a:  >
                    Our client alleges that Jones deliberately damaged our client's vessel,
                    causing $3,000 USD of damages. We are seeking compensation on behalf of
                    our client.
    summary_b:  >
                    It is our belief that Jones was operating their vessel in accordance with
                    all regulations and that the damage done to Smith's vessel was an act of
                    God. Our client should not have to pay the claimant any damages.
